                    <p>Eren Yeager (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the Survey Corps. He was the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan.[32] This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.
                        Soon afterward, his father, Grisha Yeager, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria.[34] He then injected Eren with a Titan serum.[34]
                        In the year 847, Eren, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert joined the 104th Training Corps. The three graduated with Eren ranking 5th best,[35] and they joined the Survey Corps following the battle of Trost District.[36]
                        After finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the ocean.
                        Eren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titans.[38] After eating the younger sister of Willy Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[8]</p>

                    <ul><h3 class="name">Human Form</h3>
                    <p>Eren was a young man of average height and muscular build. His facial features strongly resembled his mother's; he had a reasonably long, rounded face and sizable, expressive, gray eyes. His hair was short and black, and his bangs fell in a natural, middle-parted, curtain-type style. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular, although this was often unseen due to his relatively baggy clothing.[39] After the four-year time skip, Eren grew his hair down to his neck.
                        Eren was first seen wearing typical townsfolk attire that consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a reddish-brown coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a black scarf, which he gave to Mikasa Ackerman the day they met. As a teenager, he was often seen in the typical Survey Corps uniform while training. His casual attire consisted of a long beige shirt identical to the one he wore in his first appearance, a maroon sash around his waist, white trousers, and brown knee-high boots. He always kept the key given to him by his father dangling around his neck on a string.[40]
                        By the time Eren infiltrates Marley in the year 854, Eren had grown visibly taller, and his hair has grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that cover his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[41] After returning to Paradis Island, Eren discarded his Survey Corps attire and began wearing a white shirt with dark pants underneath a simple black mantle.[42] He tied his hair back into a bun and shaved off his mustache and goatee.[43]

                        Eren as a Titan
                        Eren's appearance changes quite drastically when he transformed into the Attack Titan. His height increased to 15 m, his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, and his tongue and ears became elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation; he developed a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes became deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that was unsuited for intelligible speech. Despite this, he was capable of howling and roaring in order to express his exhaustion and anger. In addition, he also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, so his teeth were exposed.
                        Similarly to past Attack Titan holders, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, and muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearances of regular Titans.[44]</p></ul>
                    </p></ul>
                    <ul><h3 class="name">Founding Titan form</h3>
                    <p>
                        Eren's Founding Titan was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. Initially, much of the Titan was shrouded by the steam from the Wall Titans, but its sheer size was immediately noted, towering over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extended far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan. [45]
                        The upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the "ribcage" (although it was revealed that the "ribcage" arose from the lower back). The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge. Inside the Titan, Eren's head was disconnected from his torso; having been decapitated and rejoined by Ymir's power, it was connected by additional vertebrae to what presumably was his body. Some sinew supports his scalp.
                        The Titan walked with its "ribcage", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the Rumbling.[46]
